*Jekyll requires blog post files to be named* according to the following format:
# heading 1 #
insert text Where

## heading 2 things ##
more text here

trying to block quote text now:
>“In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move"

different type of header??
-------------------------

* red
* orange
* yellow

***

1. Hello
2. goodbye
3. list

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
